# Basic Java Api Test

Set up a small development environment in your preferred programming language and test framework. Write a method that takes a string command and POSTs it to an imaginary API endpoint, http://localhost/foo. Also experimenting with just hitting the GitHub APIs and how that would work.

# Running locally instructions
- You can build the application via the command: `./gradlew build`
- You can run the tests via the command: `./gradlew test`
- You can run the application via the command: `./gradlew run`
- You can build a docker image via the command: `./gradlew buildDockerImage`
- After the image is built, you can run the docker image via the command: `docker run <image_id_from_above>`
